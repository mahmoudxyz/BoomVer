# BoomVer: Sound-Effect Versioning 🔊

> *Why count when you can boom?*

BoomVer is a fresh take on software versioning that uses sound effects instead of numbers to communicate impact and scope. It's intuitive, fun to say, and instantly communicates the significance of each release.

## 🌟 Core Concept

Traditional versioning tells you numbers. BoomVer tells you *impact*. 

Every version uses sound words that naturally communicate scale and change:

```
MainSound[-FeatureSound][-FeatureSound]...
```

---

## 🔊 MainSound Reference

MainSounds represent the overall impact and are sorted by increasing significance:

| Sound | Impact Level | Traditional Equivalent | Description |
|-------|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| `Tick` | Minimal | 0.0.1 | Minor patch or fix |
| `Ping` | Minor | 0.1.0 | Small feature addition |
| `Pop` | Notable | 0.2.0 | Noteworthy improvement |
| `Snap` | Significant | 0.5.0 | Significant update |
| `Crackle` | Major | 1.0.0 | Major release |
| `Boom` | Transformative | 2.0.0 | Complete transformation |
| `Kaboom` | Revolutionary | 3.0.0 | Revolutionary reinvention |
| `Kapow` | Explosive | 4.0.0 | Groundbreaking change |
| `Whoosh` | Accelerated | 5.0.0 | Massive leap forward |
| `Rumble` | Foundation | 6.0.0 | Foundational rebuild |

> **Note**: You don't need to use every MainSound - select the ones that fit your product.

## 🚀 Getting Started with BoomVer

### 1. Plan Your Sound Palette

Select which MainSounds align with your product roadmap and which FeatureSounds match your typical changes.

### 2. Setup Initial Version

Start with a MainSound that matches your product's maturity:
- Early development: `Tick` or `Ping`
- Beta: `Pop` or `Snap`
- Initial stable release: `Crackle`

### 3. Add to Your Project

Include in your README.md:

```markdown
## Versioning

This project uses [BoomVer](https://github.com/yourusername/boomver) for versioning.
Current version: `Crackle-Fizz-Buzz`
```

### 4. Add to Your Package Files

For package.json:
```json
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "boomver": "Crackle-Fizz-Buzz",
  "boomverMap": {
    "Crackle": "1.0.0",
    "Crackle-Fizz-Buzz": "1.1.0" 
  }
}
```

For other package managers, add a comment:
```python
# Version: 1.0.0 (BoomVer: Crackle-Fizz-Buzz)
```

### 5. Git Tagging

```bash
git tag -a "Crackle-Fizz-Buzz" -m "Major release with new features and performance"
git push origin Crackle-Fizz-Buzz
```

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Tools

### Bash Helper Function

```bash
function boomver() {
  local current=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
  local main=$1
  shift
  local features=""
  
  for feature in "$@"; do
    features="$features-$feature"
  done
  
  local new="$main$features"
  
  echo "Bumping from $current to $new"
  git tag -a "$new" -m "Version $new"
  echo "Tag created! Push with: git push origin $new"
}

# Usage:
# boomver Crackle Fizz Buzz
```

### Mapping to SemVer

For tools requiring semantic versioning:

```javascript
// boomver-map.js
const mainSoundMap = {
  'Tick': [0, 0, 1],    // 0.0.1
  'Ping': [0, 1, 0],    // 0.1.0
  'Pop': [0, 2, 0],     // 0.2.0
  'Snap': [0, 5, 0],    // 0.5.0
  'Crackle': [1, 0, 0], // 1.0.0
  'Boom': [2, 0, 0],    // 2.0.0
  'Kaboom': [3, 0, 0],  // 3.0.0
  // etc.
};

const featureSoundMap = {
  'Fizz': [0, 1, 0],    // Minor bump for new features
  'Buzz': [0, 0, 1],    // Patch bump for performance
  'Zap': [0, 0, 1],     // Patch bump for bug fixes
  'Shine': [0, 1, 0],   // Minor bump for UI changes
  'Shield': [0, 0, 1],  // Patch bump for security
  // etc.
};

function boomverToSemver(boomver) {
  const parts = boomver.split('-');
  const mainSound = parts[0];
  const featureSounds = parts.slice(1);
  
  let [major, minor, patch] = mainSoundMap[mainSound] || [0, 0, 0];
  
  featureSounds.forEach(sound => {
    const [fMajor, fMinor, fPatch] = featureSoundMap[sound] || [0, 0, 0];
    major += fMajor;
    minor += fMinor;
    patch += fPatch;
  });
  
  return `${major}.${minor}.${patch}`;
}

// Usage:
// boomverToSemver("Crackle-Fizz-Buzz") => "1.1.1"
```

## 📊 Comparison with Other Versioning Systems

| System | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **SemVer** | Technical precision | Doesn't communicate impact well |
| **CalVer** | Chronological clarity | Doesn't communicate impact at all |
| **BoomVer** | Impact clarity, memorability | Needs mapping for some tools |

---

## 📝 Example BoomVer Community Standards

- **MainSound increases** should include migration guides
- Only use **Kaboom** for truly revolutionary changes
- For **Long-Term Support** releases, add "LTS": `Crackle-LTS`
- For **Experimental** branches, add "X": `Snap-X-Fizz`

---

## 🚦 Adoption Roadmap

1. **Start Small**: Use BoomVer alongside SemVer in release notes and communications
2. **Add Tags**: Include BoomVer tags with your Git tags
3. **Update Docs**: Add BoomVer section to your README
4. **Create Helpers**: Setup automation for version bumping
5. **Spread the Word**: Communicate the value to your community
